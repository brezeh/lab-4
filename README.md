First I imported the os, csv & datetime 
then I added a keep going variable to run the program again 
then in the main function I put the get data function and the selection sort and insert sort function
then I added the getdata function to get the budget data
then I added the selsort function to sort by selection sort
then I added the insertsort function to sort by insertion sort
Then I called the main function in a while loop to ask the user if they want to run the program again and to enter y if they do
